# uafgadfv The origins of [jumpy castles](https://www.bouncehousescoloradosprings.com/) trace back to the late 1950s when engineer John Scurlock accidentally stumbled upon the idea while experimenting with inflatable covers for tennis courts. Realizing the potential for fun, Scurlock and his wife Frances founded the company that would later become known as "Space Walk," introducing the first commercial inflatable bounce house in 1968. Since then, these inflatable marvels have evolved from simple structures to elaborate creations featuring slides, obstacle courses, and themed designs inspired by popular movies, cartoons, and fairy tales.
